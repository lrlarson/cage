 <span
style='font-size:16.0pt;font-style:normal'>Macrobiotic
    Cooking</span></h2>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>THE
    MACROBIOTIC DIET has a great deal to do with yin and yang and finding a balance
    between them. I have not studied this carefully. All I do is <span class=GramE>try</span> to observe whether something suits me or not. Michio Kushi told me I should eat
    more root vegetables and less leafy ones, though he recommended watercress and
    parsley. The basis of the diet is the combination of brown rice and beans. This
    makes a protein and the rice very balanced. I’ve become very fond of it. Nuts
    and seeds are good, and vegetables may be eaten. They are good when their
    sugars are slightly caramelized (slightly burned); this is a matter of taste
    rather than diet. Some vegetables should be avoided: potatoes, tomatoes,
    eggplant and peppers particularly for those who have arthritis. Turnips,
    carrots, celeriac, the large white Japanese radishes (daikon); all these are
    good. Winter squashes are excellent. When possible eat not only the root but
    the leaves too of vegetables (including the carrot leaves). In this direction
    (away from beans or rice towards the right or sugar) avoid sugar. Eat as little
    fruit as you fail to resist. Or become very choosy; insist on the best wild
    strawberries, raspberries and melons. Honey is sugar; don’t use it. Alcohol also
    is sugar. Liquids should be reduced during a day (including water, tea, etc.)
    to two quarts. Recently in Germany I met a doctor, Renata Kelleter who
    recommended more water, bananas, and apricots. I follow her advice. In the
    other direction towards meat, you can eat a little chicken or fish, avoid
    shellfish, and eat eggs not often, though they are permitted. Avoid red and all
    dairy products.  The idea is to make a
    shift from the animal fats to the vegetable oils, and to reduce the liquids.
    Instead of brown rice you can have cous-cous, kasha, <span class=GramE>boulghour</span> (cracked wheat) quinoa. As far as quantities go, you should eat mostly grain,
    then beans, then vegetables, and least chicken or fish. Fresh salads are not
    good because they are too liquid. However, I eat tabouli which is not cooked.
    One very good way to prepare dandelion is to chop it up and sauté it in a
    little oil; then add tamari (health food soy sauce). I use Braggs Amino Acids
    instead of tamari (less salt).</span></p>

  <h3>BROWN RICE</h3>
  <p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Twice
    as much water</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'> as rice. If you wish, substitute a very little wild rice for some of the brown
    rice. Wash or soak overnight then drain. Add a small amount of hijiki (seaweed)
    and some Braggs. Very often I add a small amount of wild rice. Bring to good
    boil. Cover with cloth arid heavy lid and cook for twenty minutes over a medium
    flame; reduce flame to very low and cook thirty more minutes. Uncover. If it is
    not sticking, cook it some more. If it is sticking to the bottom of the pan,
    stir it a little and then cover again and let it rest with the fire off. When
    you look at it again after ten minutes or so it will have loosened itself from
    the bottom of the pan. </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Another
    way to cook rice: Using the same proportions of rice, bring to a boil and then
    simply cover with lid without the cloth, reducing the fire to low. After
    forty-five minutes, remove from fire but leave lid on for at least twenty
    minutes. </span></p>
  <h3>FRIED RICE</h3>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span class=GramE>Sauté scallion in a little sesame oil.</span> Add sliced celery, sesame seeds if desired, and mushrooms, with tamari or
    Braggs at the end. <span class=GramE>A fair amount of tamari.</span> <span
class=GramE>Perhaps a little lemon juice.</span> Or use leeks instead of
    scallions. <span class=GramE>Or chopped dandelions or chopped carrot tops or a
    mixture.</span> </p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Another
    way (without oil): Add to cooked rice some lemon or orange juice, pine nuts or
    chopped pecans or walnuts, and some chopped parsley, Italian or Chinese
    (coriander).</span></p>
  <h3>WALNUT CHICKEN</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Marinate
    chicken breasts cut into 1-inch cubes in 2 T tamari, 1 T sherry, 1/2 t ground
    ginger or 1/2-inch piece of ginger overnight. Heat 2 T sesame oil (total = 1/4
    C) over high flame and stir fry 2 sliced scallions, garlic clove cut into two
    pieces and 1 C of coarsely chopped walnuts. <span class=GramE>After three or
    four minutes remove garlic and transfer scallions and walnuts into a bowl.</span> Add remaining oil and chicken pieces and marinade. Stir fry about five minutes,
    until chicken is tender and coated with soy mixture. Combine with walnuts and
    onions. Serve with rice. </span></p>
  <h3>ROAST CHICKEN</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Get a
    good chicken not spoiled by agribusiness. Place in Rohmertopf (clay baking dish
    with cover) with giblets. Put a smashed clove of garlic and a slice of fresh
    ginger between legs and wings and breasts. Squeeze the juice of two or three
    lemons over the bird. Then an equal mount of tamari. Cover, place in cold oven
    turned up to 450 degrees. <span class=GramE>Leave for 1 hr.</span> Then uncover
    for 15 minutes, heat on, to brown. </span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Now I
    cook at 350 degrees, 30’ to the pound.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Or use
    hot mustard and cumin seeds instead of ginger. Keep lemon, tamari or Braggs and
    garlic. Instead of squeezing the lemon, it may be quartered then chopped fine
    in a Cuisinart with the garlic and ginger (or garlic, cumin and mustard). Add
    tamari. The chicken and sauce can be placed on a bed of carrots (or sliced
    3/4-inch thick bitter melon – obtainable in Chinatown). </span></p>
  <h3>GRUEL BREAD</h3>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>(These ideas come from the
    Tassajara Book)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Go
    through refrigerator, collecting food you no longer wish to eat: rice, beans,
    cooked vegetables or raw (parsley that’s turned yellow, etc.). Include any
    liquids you may have saved (such as water from parboiling string beans). Put
    through Cuisinart and measure. Add more than an equal amount of whole wheat
    flour. Do not work with more than 5-7 cups of gruel at the same time. Mix and
    then knead (adding dry dill weed if wished) for about 45 minutes or an hour
    until it is consistent (“all of a piece”). Then put in oiled bread pans. I use
    corn oil. After putting it in, take it out and put it back upside down. (This
    oils the entire loaf.) Take a wild knife and make a deep indentation down the
    middle of the loaf. Cover with damp cloth and leave in warm place overnight. In
    the morning back at 375 degrees for one hour and 15-20 minutes. </span></p>
  <h3>NUT BREAD</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Follow
    the recipe above, but use very few leftovers (rice and string bean water are
    fine). Add roasted unsalted nuts (walnuts, filberts, Brazil nuts, almonds,
    cashews, etc.). The nuts should be cut, but not very finely. </span></p>
  <p>These breads are good with peanut butter (make your own in a
    Cuisinart). <span class=GramE>Or smoked salmon (the Gruel Bread only).</span> <span
class=GramE>Or a slice of avocado.</span> <span class=GramE>Or alone.</span> </p>

    leaving in hot oven. </span></p>
  <h3>MISO SOUP</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>About
    three heaping tablespoons of miso paste. There are as many kinds of these as
    there are whines or cheeses. <span class=GramE>A few turnips, carrots, and
    scallions.</span> <span class=GramE>Any other vegetables.</span> <span
class=GramE>A bunch of watercress.</span> In a little sesame oil, sauté the cut
    up scallion, then the carrots and turnips, not long. Then add 4 C of good
    water. When that comes to a boil, reduce the fire to low after removing a cup
    of water to put the miso paste in. Cover and don’t simmer for longer than say
    10 minutes. Meanwhile, you’ve soaked some WAKAME (seaweed). At the penultimate
    moment add the tenderest vegetables (seaweed and cress); others you’ve already
    put in. And after turning out the flame add the cup of miso paste dissolved.
    Serve. In hot weather, chill for about 20 minutes in the freezer. </span></p>
  <h3>ZUCCHINI SPICED</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Add salt,
    turmeric <span class=GramE>sparingly,</span> and finely chopped onion to heated
    oil. Stir for a minute, add zucchini cut in pieces. Stir (covered) for 5
    minutes. Garnish with chopped nuts. </span></p>
  <h3>ZUCCHINI WITH SESAME BUTTER AND DILL</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Cut each
    courgette lengthwise twice. Sear in hot oil, cooking as quickly and as little
    as possible. Then place in casserole with a small amount of oil and a sauce
    made of tamari, fresh dill (or dried) and sesame butter or tahini. Place in a
    moderate over for, say, 45 minutes. </span></p>
  <h3>BEANS</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Soak
    beans overnight after having washed them. In the morning change the water and
    add Kombu (seaweed). <span class=GramE>Also, if you wish, rosemary or cumin.</span> Watch them so that they don’t cook too long, just until tender. Then pour off
    most of the liquid, saving it, and replace it with tamari (or Braggs). But
    taste first: you may prefer it without tamari or with very little. Taste to see
    if it’s too salty. If it is, add more bean liquid. Then, if you have the juice
    from a roasted chicken, put several teaspoons of this with the beans. Black turtle
    beans or small white beans can be cooked without soaking overnight. But large
    kidney beans or pinto beans, etc., are best soaked. (So are the others.)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Another
    way to cook beans, which has become my favorite way, is with bay leaves, thyme,
    garlic, salt, and pepper. You can cook it with some <span class=GramE>kombu</span> from the beginning. I know use the “shocking method.” See Aveline Kushi’s book.</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>And now
    I’ve changed again. A Guatemalan idea: Bury an entire plant of garlic in the
    beans without bothering to take the paper off. Cook for at least 3 hours. </span></p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>

  <h3>CHICK PEAS </h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Soak
    several hours. Then boil in new water. <span class=GramE>Until tender.</span> They can then be used in many ways. </span></p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Salad. Make a dressing of
      lemon or lime with olive oil (a little more oil than lemon), sea salt and
      black pepper, fresh dill-parsley, and a generous amount of fine French
      Mustard (e.g., Pommery).</span></li>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Or use with cous cous having
      cooked them with fresh ginger and a little saffron.</span></li>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Or make hummus. Place, say,
      two cups of chickpeas with 1/2 cup of their liquid in Cuisinart. Add a
      teaspoon salt, lots of black pepper, a little oil, and lemon juice to
      taste. Add garlic and tahini. Now I no longer add salt, but instead a
      prepared gazpacho.</span></li>
  </ol>
  <h3>MUSHROOMS</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Cut in
    reasonable pieces and sauté in canola oil (not too much oil). Cover a little
    and then uncover to reduce liquid. Before it is all gone, add a little Braggs. <span
class=GramE>Taste to decide whether lemon is needed or pepper.</span> (Use as a
    side dish or combine with rice to make Mushroom Rice).</span></p>
  <h3>NORI</h3>
  <p><span class=GramE><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>The
    thin seaweed.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'> Can be used with tamari and then wrapped around rice or it can be toasted over
    a flame and then crushed and used as a garnish on rice. </span></p>
  <h3>COUS COUS</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Get a
    good fowl. Put in couscousiere with finely chopped onion, slices of ginger and
    saffron and several cubes of chicken bouillon. After simmering for an hour and
    a half, cover with perforated part of couscousiere filled with cous cous that
    has been mixed with a cup or so of water. After half an hour of steaming this
    (uncovered), remove to a large bowl. Hand mix until no lumps are present. Add a
    little more water and mix. Then steam for another half hour. Etc. (Do this
    three times) Add vegetables to stew at appropriate times, first carrots and
    turnips, finally zucchinis. Don’t overcook these. Serve with chickpeas. </span></p>

  <h3>GREEN VEGETABLES</h3>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>(Broccoli,
    Mustard Greens, Kale, Collard Greens)</span></p>
  <ol start=1 type=1>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Get a good Chinese bamboo
      steamer. And a wok (or Metal Chinese steamer without wok). Arrange
      vegetables in the steamer. Steam briefly so that they’re still crunchy.</span></li>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Sauté over high heat in
      heavy pan with a very little sesame oil. Without liquid. When slightly
      burnt, add Braggs. </span></li>
    <li><span
     style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Or parboil quickly, saving
      the liquid to use in soups or cooking of rice, etc. This is the way I
      prefer. </span></li>
  </ol>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>SQUASH
    (Acorn, etc.)</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Bake
    without cutting open at 425 degrees for 1 hour and 15-30 minutes. (Do the same
    with any root <span class=GramE>vegetables.</span> Some like rutabaga need more
    time, if very large possibly 2-1/2 to 3 hours.)</span></p>
  <h3>STRING BEANS</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Parboil
    7 minutes. <span class=GramE>Or if they are the fine small French ones or the
    very long Chinese ones, just 4 minutes.</span> Make a dip of dampened wasabi
    (Japanese horseradish) (enough water to form a ball) with tamari. Or hot
    mustard and tamari. </span></p>
  <h3>VEGETABLE PATE</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Cook 2
    cups of soaked split peas or lentils in 8 cups of water 15 minutes. Add 1 cup
    of boulghour and stir for 15 minutes (to avoid burning). Add sautéed sliced
    onion (plenty) and Dijon mustard (to taste) plus salt and pepper. </span></p>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>MATSUTAKE</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>In a
    shallow baking pan make a bed of coarse salt. Lay lengthwise slices of
    matsutake on it. Let the slices be 3/16-1/4 inch wide. Roast in a hot oven
    briefly; don’t let them dry out. Serve with quartered juicy limes. </span></p>

  <h3>HYPOMYCES LACTIFLUORUM</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Clean
    and prepare in thick slices (3/8-1/2 inch). Brush with sesame oil. Broil. Then
    brush again with tamari alone or tamari with dampened wasabi or tamari with
    dampened hot mustard. Serve. </span></p>
  <h3>PUFFBALL LASAGNA</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Treat
    1/2-3/4 inch slices of puffball as though they were pasta. Make a mixture of
    flavorful mushrooms sautéed in sesame oil and then “salted” with tamari (<i>Polyporus frondosus, Craterellus
    cornucopioides, Marasmius oreades, Lepiotas procera, rachodes, </i>or<i> Americana</i>) and another of tofu mixed
    with miso to take the place of cheese. <span class=GramE>Alternate layers of
    these with the slices of puffball in a deep baking dish.</span>  Place in moderately hot oven until well
    amalgamated, about forty-five minutes or an hour. </span></p>
  <h3>ROOT VEGETABLES</h3>
  <p><span class=GramE><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Carrots, Turnips, Jerusalem
    Artichokes, etc.</span></span><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'> Place in a Rohmertopf (clay baking dish) in a hot oven for an hour or more with
    a little, very little, sesame oil. They may be covered with leeks and topped
    with a mixture such as one of those suggested for roast chicken. </span></p>
  <h3>SOUP DES JOURS</h3>
  <p><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman","serif"'>Choose
    a large round pot (e.g., Le Creuset). Start with water from soaking seaweed
    (Mekabu is especially good) or from cooking 100% buckwheat soba. Add any
    vegetables (roots and / or leafy ones and / or mushrooms: burdock, carrots,
    etc., first; at the last minute radish, turnip tops or even fresh carrot tops
    put through the Cuisinart) and / or beans, cooked rice, etc., but nothing
    cooked in oil. Keep on the stove, not necessarily on a fire except when warming
    up or adding root vegetables. Change the flavor each day by the addition of
    leftovers or an entirely new ingredient such as freshly chopped (in a
    Cuisinart) parsley or mustard greens. Before each serving add Bragg’s Liquid
    Aminos or some other vegetable protein or tamari to taste, and freshly ground

    oil.</span> Combine everything in the Cuisinart. <span class=GramE>Let cook.</span> </span></p>

    cayenne, and chopped parsley. Decorate with 3 pieces of bay leaf. Put in a
    Rohmertopf, cover and cook for 1-1/2 hours at 400 degrees. </p>
