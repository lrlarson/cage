  <p class="description">
    We insist that anything you post here be in the spirit of common sense, common courtesy, and common decency.</p>
  <p class="description">Some rules about site content (for particulars, read on):</p>
  <p class="description">You will not post anything in violation of anyone’s intellectual property rights, including without limitation copyright or trademark.  See below for a more detailed restatement of this policy.</p>
  <p class="description">You give the JCT a perpetual, royalty-free, worldwide license to copy and publish anything you post here, even if you delete your posting.  As a matter of courtesy the JCT may, at its complete discretion, and upon your very polite request, if convenient, de-publish anything that you posted and deleted here.  If this is a matter of concern for you, do not post here.  See below for a more detailed restatement of this policy.</p>
  <p class="description">You will not copy, publish, or distribute any part of or contents displayed on the Website in any medium without the JCT’s prior written authorization.</p>
  <p class="description">You will not alter or modify any part of the Website other than by uploading materials as invited by the Website.</p>
  <p class="description">Some rules for and about registered users:</p>

  <p class="description">You may never use another's account without permission.</p>
  <p class="description">When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information.</p>
  <p class="description">You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account.  You – and you alone -- must keep your account password secure. We are not your mother and we will not be responsible for what could happen if you give the wrong person your password.</p>
  <p class="description">Please notify <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#106;&#111;&#104;&#110;&#99;&#97;&#103;&#101;&#46;&#111;&#114;&#103;">info@johncage.org</a> immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.</p>

  <p class="description">You won't, without permission from the JCT, use or launch any automated system such as bots or spiders that accesses the Website in a manner that sends more request messages to the johncage.org servers in a given period of time than a human can reasonably produce in the same period by using a conventional on-line web browser.</p>

  <p class="description">You agree not to solicit, for commercial purposes, any users of the Website with respect to their User Submissions.</p>

  <p class="description"><strong><u>Grant of Permission to Search Engines:</u></strong></p>
  <p class="description">Johncage.org grants the operators of public search engines such as Google, Bing, and all others permission to use spiders to copy materials from the site for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials except so as to facilitate searching.</p>
  <p class="description">JCT reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases.</p><br />
  <p class="description"><strong><u>Intellectual Property Rights Fully Reserved:</u></strong></p>

  <p class="description">You agree not to circumvent, disable, or otherwise interfere with security related features of the johncage.org Website or features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any Content or enforce limitations on use of the johncage.org Website or the Content therein.</p>
  <p class="description">Johncage.org reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Website and the Content.</p><br />
  <p class="description"><strong><u>Site Content, especially the license you hereby grant to JCT in User Submissions:</u></strong></p>
  <p class="description">The johncage.org Website permits you to post your words, and, eventually, images.  We call these User Submissions. Whether or not such User Submissions are published, johncage.org does not guarantee any confidentiality with respect to submissions.</p>
  <p class="description">You shall be solely responsible for your own User Submissions and the consequences of posting or publishing them. You warrant that:</p>
  <p class="description">*you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize johncage.org to use all patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, and/or other proprietary rights in and to any and all User Submissions to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service; and</p>
  <p class="description">*you have the written consent, release, and/or permission of each and every identifiable person in the User Submission to use the name or likeness of each and every such identifiable person to enable inclusion and use of the User Submissions in the manner contemplated by the Website and these Terms of Service.</p>
  <p class="description">For clarity and not by way of limitation, except as set forth herein, you retain all of your ownership rights in your User Submissions.   By submitting them, however, you thereby grant the JCT a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sub-licensable, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the User Submissions in connection with the johncage.org Website and the JCT (and its legal successors, if any).</p>
  <p class="description">The license you hereby grant includes the JCT’s promoting and redistributing part or all of the johncage.org Website (and derivative works) in any media formats and through any media channels.</p>
  <p class="description">Moreover, you will not post any threatening, harassing, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive statements or materials that encourage conduct that would be considered a criminal offense anywhere they might be reading this, give rise to civil liability, violate any law, or is otherwise seriously inappropriate anywhere on Earth.  Nondeletion of any content does not imply agreement with or tolerance by the JCT of the nondeleted content.</p>
  <p class="description">Nothing herein assures you the right that the JCT will give you the ability to remove or delete a User Submission from johncage.org.</p>
  <p class="description">The JCT does not endorse any User Submission or any opinion, recommendation, or advice expressed therein. The JCT expressly disclaims any and all liability in connection with User Submissions.  The JCT reserves the right to remove Content and User Submissions without prior notice. Do not assume that if the JCT hasn't removed it that it endorses it.</p>
  <p class="description">The JCT reserves the right to terminate your access to its Website if we catch you breaking these rules.  The JCT also reserves the right to decide whether Content or a User Submission is appropriate and complies with these Terms of Use for anything, but especially copyright infringement and violations of intellectual property law, obscene or defamatory material, and in every other way in its complete discretion.</p>
  <p class="description">Johncage.org may remove User Submissions and terminate your access at any time, without prior notice and at its sole discretion.</p>
