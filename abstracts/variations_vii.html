The ten artists included John Cage, whose <em>Variations VII</em> was the next to last in his series of indeterminate works begun in 1958, and which made increasing use of electronic equipment and systems to capture and manipulate sounds present at the time of the performance. This rare and historical film – made up of archival footage of the performance and documentary interviews -- is the second in the “9 Evenings” series from E.A.T. and was produced by Billy Klüver and Julie Martin of E.A.T. and directed by Barbro Schultz Lundestam. </span></div></body></html>
