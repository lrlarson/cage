While the number of “<em>Indeterminacy</em>” stories Cage actually wrote is likely incalculable, those heard in this performance are the ones Cage prepared for his 1959 Folkways recording (available as a reissue from Smithsonian Folkways, CD or download).  The stories are read aloud, each paced to take precisely one minute, with or without “musical accompaniment”.  For this performance, Laura Kuhn will perform the vocal component of the score, and Marina Rosenfeld, performing on turntables with a selection of now-historic LPs of Cage’s works as her palette, will interpret the “musical accompaniment” aspect</span></div></body></html>
