Ignoring the philosophical debate about its true nature, we can agree that we use it, both in science and philosophy, as a tool to guide us through dimensions.  Regardless of how Cage used time; as a rigid structure to denote the beginning and end of a timed production of sound, as a guide for replicable chance, or as a substitute for conductor, it was a likely element in his creative process. Simply, for Cage, time was either the vehicle or the road. I will discuss the timepieces John Cage held dear and give my opinion of Cage through the &quot;eyes&quot; of his watch. His watch, today, taught me that it is difficult to comprehend structure in a happenstance of unpredictable events.</span></p></div></body></html>
