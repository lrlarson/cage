The ten artists included David Tudor who performed <em>Bandoneon!</em>, a work in which he played a traditional instrument (the bandoneon) as the input into a complex sound and visual modification system that moved sound from speaker to speaker, turned lights off and on, and produced large video images, creating a work that animated the entire Armory space.  Engineers Fred Waldhauer and Reobert Kieronski and composer Lowell Cross joined Tudor and contributed to the technical components of the work. </em></span></p>  <p class="description">This rare and historical film – the third in the “9 Evenings” series -- was produced by Billy Klüver and Julie Martin of E.A.T. and directed by Julie Martin.</p>  <p><br />  </p></div></body></html>
